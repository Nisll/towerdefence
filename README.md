# Tower Defence (WIP Title)

Fallen Garden (WIP Title) is a 2D Tower-Defence Survival game for the PC, powered with the GameMaker engine, to create an imaginative lawn of growth and destruction by the hands of the player, a little protagonist, in efforts to preserve his grandmotherâ€™s dying wish, her sentimental garden.

### Prerequisites

GameMaker: Studio

Paint.NET

Tiled

### Running Tests

Download the project file, compile it to .exe in GameMaker: Studio ...

### Coding Styles

Darkydude: My preferred coding style in GameMaker: Studio is a combination of snake case and camel case.
For example, obj_battleCharacter, the extension is always snake_case with the name in camelCase.
For scripts and code blocks, I always include a title and banner comment ... /// sc_script(parameters,in,here)
